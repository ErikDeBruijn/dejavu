# Deja Vu

Deja Vu is a framework that allows both backtesting and real-time processing of events (e.g. price movements, Tweets, etc.) to result in actions (e.g. buy/sell a coin or stock, turn on an electricity consuming device, charge a battery, etc.).

When backtesting, essentially, all actions are simulated and you can infer from historical information how a policy or set of policies would have worked in the past and subsequently decide to run the exact same policies real time.
